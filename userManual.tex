\section{Othello Rules}
Othello, also known as Reversi, is a board game dating back to  Each of the two players has 32 tiles, with both a black and white face. The board is an 8x8 grid of places for those tiles to be played. The players alternate playing tiles, with their color face up. In order for a move to be valid, the move must sandwich a row of the opposing players tiles.\\\\
$\bullet$ o o o\\
$\bullet$ o o o $\bullet$ (This is a valid move)\\\\
The tiles which are sandwiched are flipped to match the color of the figurative bread of the sandwich.\\\\
$\bullet$ $\bullet$ $\bullet$ $\bullet$ $\bullet$ (Notice how the middle white chips were flipped)\\\\
 The goal is to have the majority of the board your color when the game ends. The game ends when neither player can play. If only one player can play, he or she should keep playing until either the game ends, or the other player can play again. 
\section{Using the Applet}
As a user, you play black tiles. You are playing against the CPU, who plays white tiles. Click the square where you would like to play. If the game ends, a small window will come up, and the game will restart.
